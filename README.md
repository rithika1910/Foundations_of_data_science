# GLOBAL TERRORISM
The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation is called Terrorism.
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database ncluding information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic
data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained
by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

Objective and motivation:
In first part our project, we analyze the data available in the global terrorism database (GTD). This analysis will provide insight about terrorism occuring at different parts of the world and their impact on the society. 
In the second part of our project, our main aim is to do a binary classification that classifies terror attacks as a ‘successful mission’ or a ‘failed mission’ depending upon the independent features provided in the global terrorism database.
